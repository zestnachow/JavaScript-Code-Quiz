# JavaScript-Code-Quiz

# Description

For this assignment, we were required to create a brief JavaScript coding quiz from scratch. In addition to a foundation of HTML and CSS for page structure and styling, respectively, extensive JS logic was required to configure a countdown clock, display multiple questions to the user, evaluate the user's answer accuracy, create a running tally for the score, and calculate/store/display the user's final score (alongside a list of all other scores persisting in local memory).
